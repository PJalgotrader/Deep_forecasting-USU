## üìö Course Overview

This comprehensive course introduces students to state-of-the-art time series forecasting techniques, progressing from classical statistical methods to advanced deep learning architectures. Students will gain hands-on experience with real-world forecasting problems using industry-standard tools and frameworks.

### üéØ Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Master fundamental time series concepts and decomposition techniques
- Implement classical forecasting methods (ETS, ARIMA/SARIMA)
- Apply machine learning algorithms to time series problems
- Design and train deep neural networks for sequence modeling
- Deploy production-ready forecasting models at scale
- Evaluate and compare model performance using appropriate metrics
